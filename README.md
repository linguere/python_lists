Lists in Python and some methods for list objects   
I try to help to python developers to know the lists and all the methods the we use to manipulate the lists.
With the methods, we can cite : 
append() to add a new item at the end in the lists;
insert() to add a new item. We can specify a position to insert the item in the lists;
etc. 

See all the examples in the paper, you will know the lists and there methods.
